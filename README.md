This project allows to calculate your bioage based on the follows parameters:
1. ADS – systolic blood pressure in mmHg,
2. ADD – diastolic blood pressure in mmHg,
3. ADP – the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure in mmHg,
4. ZDVdoh – breath retention on inspiration in seconds,
5. ZDVydoh – breath retention on exhalation in seconds,
6. VEL – vital capacity of the lungs in ml,
7. mass – body weight in kg,
8. accommodation in diopters,
9. hearing acuity in white,
10. static balancing in seconds

This project uses the model made by me and described in the article Modeling the biological age of the patients based on their
functional indicators doi:10.26102/2310-6018/2021.33.2.028
